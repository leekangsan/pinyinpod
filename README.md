# pinyinpod
Compiles glossaries to Pinyinbase JSON files. Requires [Node.js][nodejs_page].


### Quick Start

**Install Node.js with a package manager.**
+ [Learn more.][gh_getnode]
+ On Mac? `$ brew install node`

**Clone this repo.**
+ `$ git clone https://github.com/pffy/pinyinpod`

**Build a new Pinyinbase.**
+ From repo root directory, type `$ node pod.js`
+ Outfile (pinyinbase) appears in the repo root (for now, but this may change).

### PINYINBASE is the Product

> **NOTE:** Please keep in mind that the PRODUCT is [PINYINBASE][gh_pinyinbase] -- not PINYINPOD -- and certainly not any simple demo that may be included for your reference. So, please do not expect fancy, advanced dictionary management tools. For now, please expect a simple compile of dictionary source files to a JSON file, then a simple demo of that JSON file in use. Thank you.
